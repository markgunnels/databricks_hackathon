- Look at the Notebook at the bottom to see that this worked:

It identifies drug drug interactions based on Open FDA Information:

````
Example:
('Here is a concise bullet list summarizing the identified drug-drug '
 'interactions:\n'
 '\n'
 '• Simvastatin may increase the risk of myopathy and rhabdomyolysis when '
 'taken with Amlodipine Besylate.\n'
 '• Amlodipine Besylate increases systemic exposure to Simvastatin and may '
 'require dose limitation to 20 mg daily.\n'
 '• Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding when taken with NSAIDs (Ketorolac '
 'Tromethamine).\n'
 '• Clopidogrel increases risk of bleeding when taken with Other Antiplatelet '
 'Agents (Clopidogrel itself).\n'
 '• The concurrent use of Metoprolol Tartrate with Amlodipine Besylate may '
 'produce an additive reduction in myocardial contractility.\n'
 '• The concurrent use of Metoprolol Tartrate with Lisinopril may increase the '
 'antihypertensive effect of beta-blockers.\n'
 '• JARDIANCE (Empagliflozin) increases the risk of hypoglycemia when taken '
 'with METFORMIN HYDROCHLORIDE (insulin secretagogue).\n'
 '• JARDIANCE (Empagliflozin) increases the risk of volume depletion when '
 'taken with Lisinopril (diuretic).')
